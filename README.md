# Real Time Collision Handling
## Project Description
The project was originally built utilising Directx11  utlising the legacy [DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=6812) it is has now suggested to utilise the modern Windows SDK instead. Instead of implementing the newer SDK for DirectX11 I have decided to learn DirectX12 to update this project. There are more details contained within the respository archiving my learning of this updated SDK [found here](https://github.com/MoAgilah/Introduction-to-Game-Programming-with-DirectX12).
The project itself demonstrates the following Real time collision handling techniques:
- Intersection tests for Moving Sphere To Sphere.
- Intersection tests for Ray Sphere.
- Intersection tests for Ray Cyclinder.
- Intersection tests for Ray Triangle.
- Intersection tests for Sphere Poly Intersection.
- One Dimensional Sweep And Prune
- Collision resolution - impulse, coefficient of restitution, bounce, rest

On the update of the project to a DirectX12 project, I intend to add the following:
- [ ] improve coming to a rest.
- [ ] introduce bounding hierarchy volume.
- [ ] Real time collision checks.
